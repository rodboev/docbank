# AGENTS.md

Instructions for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## Build and Test

- Go 1.27+ (go.mod is authoritative). Go 1.26 value-form `new(v)` and Go
  1.27 generic methods, promoted struct-literal fields, and assignment-context
  inference are in use; verify against the toolchain before treating unfamiliar
  syntax as an error.
- Every build and test needs the fts5 tag: `make test` or
  `go test -tags fts5 ./...`. CGO builds use mattn SQLite; the supported
  pure-Go path uses `CGO_ENABLED=0` and modernc SQLite. Keep the complete suite
  passing in both modes.
- Lint with `make lint` (golangci-lint, fts5 tag). Docs build strict with
  `make docs-build`; fix every warning.
- Linux, macOS, and Windows are supported. Windows CI runs the complete CLI,
  daemon, lock, backup, and restore suite on amd64 and arm64; do not replace
  real platform behavior with compile-only stubs.
- The embedded web application uses Node 24+ and its dependencies are locked in
  `frontend/package-lock.json`. Run `make frontend-test` for type, kit-ui,
  unit, and production-build checks. Release CI builds the frontend once and
  embeds those exact assets in all six platform archives.
- Real documentation screenshots use the repository-owned Playwright harness in
  `frontend/screenshots/`. Run `make docs-screenshots`; captures must use
  its temporary synthetic vault and real daemon, never a developer vault or
  mocked API data. Generated images stay under `.superpowers/screenshots/`
  until they are visually inspected and published as a complete reviewed set.
  Publish the complete set as one orphan `docs-assets` commit, then pin that
  exact commit in `scripts/docs-assets.ref`. Documentation builds consume the
  pin and never generate screenshots or follow a mutable branch head.
- Run `make docs-serve` from the repository root to build, watch, and preview
  the product page, authority guide, and operating documentation on one origin.
  Run `make docs-build` after the final source or asset-pin edit. The strict
  build stages only the explicit public allowlist into `site/`; internal plans,
  scripts, and agent instructions must not enter the output.

## Private Data Boundary

- Never put private developer information in tracked files. Tests, fixtures,
  golden files, examples, and documentation must use synthetic data—not files,
  filenames, directory structure, document contents, credentials, session
  transcripts, hashes, or metadata copied from a developer's home directory or
  personal corpus.
- Access a real personal corpus only with explicit authorization for that
  validation. Keep the source read-only, work in an owner-private isolated
  directory outside the repository, and emit only aggregate evidence unless
  the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Before handing off a real-corpus validation, stop its processes and remove
  every temporary vault, backup, restore, binary, report, mismatch list, log,
  and cache created for the run—even when the validation fails. Confirm the
  cleanup rather than assuming a deferred cleanup ran.

## Git Rules

1. Commit every turn that changes tracked files; never amend.
2. Never push to or commit on main — feature branches and PRs only.
3. Do not merge pull requests; opening and reporting them is the agent's
   job, merging is the user's.
4. Run `prek run` before committing.
5. Write pull request descriptions for humans. Lead with the user-visible
   outcome in plain language and, when useful, one concrete example. Explain
   the important safety boundary or tradeoff without making the reader decode
   internal types, record names, endpoints, or implementation chronology.
   Keep the rationale, but avoid robotic implementation inventories.
6. Do not add routine `Validation`, `Testing`, or checklist sections for
   `make test`, lint, docs, vet, `prek`, CI, or ordinary conformance suites;
   report those results in the handoff instead. Include validation in the PR
   body only when it is novel evidence that materially informs review, such as
   a migration rehearsal, benchmark, real-vault hardening run, or compatibility
   experiment.
7. Every pull request that changes the web app or TUI must include a screenshot
   of the actual rendered interface in the PR description. Use only synthetic
   data, visually inspect the image before publishing it, and never substitute a
   mockup for the implemented UI.
8. Do not watch, poll, or wait for GitHub Actions or pull request checks unless
   the user explicitly asks you to monitor them. A request to open, update, or
   make a pull request merge-ready does not authorize ongoing CI monitoring.

## Releases

- Cut releases only from a clean local `main` that exactly matches
  `origin/main`.
- Preview notes with `scripts/changelog.sh <version>`; publish with
  `scripts/release.sh <version> [extra_instructions] [start_tag]`. Supply the
  optional start tag only when notes must span an intervening tag that did not
  publish.
- The release script creates and pushes an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag. The release
  workflow uses the tag body as GitHub release notes and falls back to generated
  notes only for a lightweight or empty tag.

## Design Invariants

- Standalone CLI operation is daemon-first: CLI commands are HTTP clients
  (`client.Ensure`) and never open a vault directly. Go applications may use
  the public embedded API to own separately rooted vaults in-process. Embedded
  and daemon ownership share the same exclusive hierarchy lock; never create a
  privileged path into a daemon-owned vault.
- The daemon always enforces an API key (ephemeral per-run when none is
  configured, published via the runtime record). Binds are loopback-only.
- Packed storage is managed, not a user-selected format. The ordinary operator
  surface is status, pack, and repack. Do not expose Kit's unpack primitive as
  a general API or CLI command; reserve it for tests, migrations, or a
  purpose-built emergency recovery workflow with a demonstrated need.
- Documentation is not the implementation tracker. User- and agent-facing
  pages describe the behavior included in their target release snapshot and
  its current limitations. Architecture and internal pages may preserve
  durable future design under explicit `!!! info "Planned"` admonitions, but
  must not carry task breakdowns, sequencing, ownership, or completion
  criteria. `docs/roadmap.md` is the one high-level public product-status view;
  kata is the sole source of truth for actionable work and its status.
- Public documentation deployment is gated by the corresponding software
  release tag. There is no rendered preview or public deployment of candidate
  feature documentation before that binary is tagged. Treat public-doc sources
  on `main` as the candidate documentation for the next release, not as a live
  view of an unreleased binary. Once a capability merges, describe it directly
  in present tense; do not add "next release", source-build availability, or
  other feature-timing annotations. Release preparation must verify that every
  documented capability is present in the tag and defer documentation for
  anything that will not ship.
- The release's own changelog entry is intentionally added after the tag and
  GitHub release exist, in a documentation-only follow-up PR using the final
  published notes and date. Wording-only corrections found during that pass may
  ship with it. The website is then deployed from the resulting `main` commit.
  That post-tag documentation commit is not expected to be contained in the
  software tag and does not require a second patch release, provided it does
  not advertise product behavior absent from the released binary.
- v0.9.0 is the first released storage compatibility boundary. Preserve vaults
  created by every supported public release across upgrades. When a released
  SQLite layout is incompatible with the current schema, export its logical
  authority through deterministic JSONL, build and validate a fresh
  current-schema database, restore physical pack authority separately, then
  atomically install it while retaining a recoverable source database. Do not
  accumulate in-place `ALTER TABLE` migration ladders or compatibility logic
  for layouts that never shipped. Every released-format cutover needs an exact
  released-schema fixture and direct oldest-supported-to-current coverage in
  both SQLite modes. Every post-v0.9 layout records an explicit monotonically
  increasing storage schema version; v0.9 is the only layout recognized by an
  inferred structural fingerprint. Keep source-version readers available for
  every supported release, and keep metadata JSONL at format v1 until a
  released logical-format change actually requires a new version and a
  deterministic import normalizer.

## kata issue tracker

This project uses [kata](https://github.com/kenn-io/kata) as its shared issue
ledger. Run `kata quickstart` at the start of each session for the full agent
contract. The short version:

- Search before creating: `kata search "<keywords>" --agent`.
- Prefer updating existing issues over duplicates (`kata comment`, `kata label add`, `kata edit`).
- Default to `--agent` for ordinary reads and mutations; use `--json` only when a script needs structured data.
- Close only verified work: `kata close <ref> --done --message "<scope + verification>" --commit <sha>`.
- If work is incomplete, label `needs-review` and comment what remains rather than closing.
- Never `kata delete` or `kata purge` without explicit user authorization.
