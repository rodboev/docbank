title: Document Understanding in Go
description: Choose Go packages for document extraction, canonical evidence, renditions, and embeddings without opening a Docbank vault.

# Document Understanding in Go

Use Docbank's Go packages to prepare documents for text search, OCR, or
embeddings in your own application. OCR extracts text from document images.
Embeddings represent text or media as numeric vectors for similarity search.
Importing these packages does not start a daemon or open a vault.

Start with the provider-neutral contracts in `document`. Choose a provider
only after deciding what bytes your application may send and what results it
may retain. A rendition is a derived, readable representation of a document;
canonical evidence is the validated text and source locations behind it.

| Your application needs to… | Package under `go.kenn.io/docbank/` |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Validate evidence, build renditions, and prepare embedding inputs | `document` |
| Build or validate a canonical timed transcript artifact | `document/mediatranscript` |
| Identify provider destinations and define retrieval policy | `document/embedding` |
| Compare retrieval approaches | `document/embedding/eval` |
| Use a provider-neutral OCR interface or local GLM-OCR | `document/ocr`, `document/glmocr` |
| Detect media formats and enforce input limits | `document/media` |
| Stage exact bytes for an authorized provider upload | `document/upload` |
| Bind outbound connections to a declared destination | `document/providerhttp` |
| Convert CSV locally for PDF OCR | `document/csvpdf` |
| Convert DOCX locally to a bounded PDF | `document/renderpdf` |
| Inspect exact physical page frames and render verified PNGs locally | `document/pagerender` |

These are reusable Go contracts. Vault-owned publication, consent, backup, and
search are described in [Document processing](architecture/document-processing.md).
The [daemon configuration](configuration.md#embedding-workers-and-credentials)
reference separately lists its executable embedding adapters.

## Choose a rendition provider

[Verified page images](architecture/page-images.md) documents the optional pinned
local page runtime. Page geometry and images are separate from text renditions.

Each adapter implements a bounded extraction contract. “Operator-hosted” means
you run the service and declare its destination; “hosted” means the adapter
calls an external provider. The exact format list and limits belong to the
provider descriptor and profile, not to a filename extension.

| Provider package | Where it runs | Contract and scope |
|------------------|---------------|--------------------|
| [`document/plaintext`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/plaintext) | In process | UTF-8 text, including declared source, structured-text, CSV, and mail formats; one generic unit with degraded provenance |
| [`document/suppliedtranscript`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/suppliedtranscript) | In process | Caller-held transcript text for bounded WAV and MP3, plus supplied SubRip captions for WAV, MP3, and MP4 originals; captions produce timed segment units with supplied provenance |
| [`document/pymupdf`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/pymupdf) | Local process | PDF text through a pinned, digest-verified executable |
| [`document/trafilatura`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/trafilatura) | Local process | Supplied HTML through a pinned isolated runner; the native runner requires Linux namespace and Landlock support |
| [`document/docling`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/docling) | Operator-hosted | Uploaded files through Docling Serve; structured output and Markdown |
| [`document/marker`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/marker) | Operator-hosted | PDF, common images, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, and HTML through the fixed Marker contract |
| [`document/unstructured`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/unstructured) | Operator-hosted | Pinned broad-format compatibility profile for the standard rendition bridge |
| [`document/tika`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/tika) | Operator-hosted | Pinned Apache Tika compatibility profile for the standard rendition bridge |
| [`document/datalab`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/datalab) | Hosted | Uploaded files through Datalab Convert |
| [`document/mistral`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/mistral) | Hosted | Capability-probed PDF, PPTX, optional renderpdf-backed DOCX, and fourteen text-family OCR formats, including the rendition-provider adapter |
| [`document/llamaparse`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/llamaparse) | Hosted | Resumable PDF parsing through the fixed LlamaParse v1 API |
| [`document/reducto`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/reducto) | Hosted | Resumable PDF and PPTX parsing through the fixed Reducto API |
| [`document/bridge`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/bridge) | Declared service | `docbank-rendition/v1`: submit, poll, cancel, and validate canonical source evidence |

Unstructured and Tika supply compatibility profiles for an operator's bridge;
they do not install those services. Local-process providers also require the
operator to supply the pinned runtime. Trafilatura on macOS or Windows requires
an explicitly supplied, audited `IsolatedRunner`.

The rendition contract accepts an `AuthorizedUpload` bound to one inspected
source. Providers cannot substitute a source URL for those bytes. Their
receipts record the exact source, policy, provider identity, and bounded usage.
See the [provider contract](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/provider.go)
and [rendition bridge schema](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/bridge/openapi.yaml)
for the normative types and wire format.

## Build canonical evidence and a rendition

Use `NormalizeEvidenceV1` when an extractor can report source locations and
structure. It validates `SourceEvidenceV1` and produces
`NormalizedEvidenceV1` with stable identities for ordered units, regions,
artifacts, and omissions. Locators distinguish pages, slides, sheets, records,
messages, lines, media segments, and other document units. Media segments use
half-open millisecond intervals: the start is included and the end is excluded.
Adjacent and overlapping segments are valid, and an absent time remains absent.
Completeness explicitly reports
`complete`, `partial`, or `degraded_provenance`; readable text alone does not
prove complete source coverage.

`BuildRenditionV1` derives sanitized Markdown, normalized units, and lexical
segments from that evidence. Lexical segments are model-independent text spans
for keyword search. Embedding chunks are built separately with the selected
model's tokenizer. `MarshalNormalizedEvidenceV1` produces the canonical
retained evidence bytes and checksum.

The owning contracts are [evidence](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/evidence.go),
[evidence validation and normalization](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/evidence_codec.go),
and [renditions](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/rendition.go).

## Normalize provider output

`document.NormalizeDocument` is the simpler text-normalization contract for
ordered source units, such as pages. It turns those units into consistent text.
The result includes heading paths, chunks, checksums, and
source spans that locate each result in the original input. The same input and
policy produce the same result.

```go
policy, err := document.NewNormalizePolicy(2_000_000)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

normalized, err := document.NormalizeDocument(document.SourceDocument{
	Family:   "pdf",
	UnitKind: "page",
	Units: []document.SourceUnit{
		{Index: 0, Markdown: "# Quarterly report\n\nRevenue increased."},
	},
}, policy)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

The policy's structural values are fixed for its normalization version. The
only caller-selected input is the maximum normalized document size. A future
change to the algorithm or structural values requires a new normalization
version rather than silently changing the meaning of existing checksums.
Source family and unit-kind identifiers must be valid UTF-8 without control
characters so they remain stable in fingerprints and provider-facing locators.
Version 3 binds truncation into unit, chunk, and document checksums. A complete
shorter document therefore cannot share an identity with a longer document
whose retained evidence or remaining units were truncated by a normalization
bound.

## Build evidence from a supplied transcript

Applications that already have transcript text can pass it through the same evidence and rendition contracts as other document families:

```go
evidencePolicy, err := document.NewEvidencePolicy(100_000)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
evidence, artifact, err := document.BuildTranscriptEvidenceV1(
	document.SuppliedTranscript{Provider: "beeper", Text: transcript}, evidencePolicy,
)
if err != nil {
	return err
}
_ = artifact // retain the provider transcript with the source record
```

Use a lowercase identifier for the provider. The `supplied-transcript/v1`
JSON artifact keeps the exact provider name and transcript text. Normalized
evidence and the rendition—the derived document result—still apply their
Unicode, Markdown, and character limits.

The evidence uses the `audio` family, a generic unit, and
`degraded_provenance` completeness. Supplied text has no timing or speaker
information. Your application must associate it with the audio source and
source version. This function does not inspect audio, run speech recognition,
verify the provider's identity, or create ingestion and search records.

An application that wants the same transcript to travel through the rendition
contract, sealed upload, authorization, receipt, and retained artifact can
construct a `document/suppliedtranscript` provider whose `Source` uses the
sealed audio digest as its key. The provider identity includes the caller's
source binding. Use a different binding for each transcript source to give it
a distinct descriptor. Docbank cannot verify that the binding identifies the
`Source` implementation or the transcripts it returns.

Use `document/mediatranscript` when the source supplies segment timing. Its
`media-transcript/v1` artifact retains ordered text, exact start and end
milliseconds, and an optional speaker for each segment. `ParseSubRip` accepts
the bounded `subrip/v1` grammar, keeps styling tags verbatim, and infers
nothing about language, speakers, or timing. `Build` converts that artifact
into audio or video source evidence and a retained transcript artifact. Segment
starts must not regress, but adjacent and overlapping cues remain distinct.
Speaker text participates in evidence identity when present; omitting it keeps
the supplied form free of invented values.

## Run Mistral OCR safely

Mistral uploads are refused until an operator supplies a validated capability
manifest for the configured endpoint, model, and policy. A capability manifest
records what a live provider probe demonstrated. Docbank supplies no live
manifest; provider documentation alone does not authorize uploads.

The operator prepares that evidence in this order:

1. Call `WriteProbeFixtures` to create synthetic test documents.
2. Call `ValidateProbeFixtures` locally, without credentials or HTTP.
3. Create `NewClient(API key)` and call `RunCapabilityProbe`.
4. Review and retain the resulting `CapabilityManifest`.

Fixture generation creates the candidate formats deterministically. Five legacy
formats require operator-supplied synthetic seeds named `doc`, `ppt`, `xls`,
`numbers`, and `msg`. Fixture and staging directories must be private. The
authenticated probe authorizes PDF through a provider-request bound. It can
authorize PPTX when its local slide count matches the provider's processed
units. It records
primary-fixture evidence for TXT, Markdown, CSV, JSON, JSONL, YAML, Go,
Python, JavaScript, RST, LaTeX, XML, EML, and MSG after provider acceptance.
XLSX remains unauthorized for production uploads, even when extraction succeeds
during a probe.

Text formats use `provider_response` enforcement. Docbank does not count lines,
records, or messages as pages. It checks that Mistral returns at least one page,
that the number of returned pages equals `pages_processed`, and that both stay
within `MaxUnits`. A CSV with more than 5,000 rows can therefore be submitted
when it fits the input byte limits.

Before upload, `MaxDocumentBytes` limits every file. Text detection also rejects
text inputs above 50 MiB. These byte limits do not establish a provider page or
spending limit. Mistral may process and charge for a document before Docbank
rejects an over-limit response. Applications that require a pre-upload page or
spending bound must not authorize text formats through this route.

Capability manifests use schema v4. Existing v3 manifests are rejected for all
formats, including PDF and PPTX. Rerun the authenticated capability probe and
replace the manifest before processing documents. Also rerun the probe if
validation reports that a registered format "does not explain its unverified
bound". Review application consent against the resulting policy fingerprint.

DOCX has a separate production route. Set `PolicyConfig.RenderPDF` to a
validated `renderpdf.Policy` and supply PDF capability evidence in the same
manifest. `Policy.Authorize` keeps the original DOCX identity but grants a
local-exact bound for the render route. A native DOCX probe result remains a
diagnostic `UnitBoundNone` observation and does not authorize native DOCX
bytes.

For each production document:

1. Call `Policy.Authorize(validated manifest, declared format)`.
2. Check your application's consent record against `PolicyFingerprint`.
3. Call `Prepare` with private staging storage.
4. Call `Process`; the detected format must match the authorization.
5. Call `Release` on success or failure.
6. Call `NormalizeDocument(Result.Document, Policy.NormalizePolicy())` on a
   successful result.

`Prepare` copies one input into a private, bounded, immutable staging file.
For direct formats, `Process` reopens and verifies those bytes for every attempt.
It derives request options from the policy and authorization, bounds the
response, and converts
validated provider output into `document.SourceDocument`. For configured DOCX,
it calls `renderpdf.Convert` once, counts the generated PDF, checks
`MaxUnits` and `MaxDocumentBytes` before HTTP, and uploads that PDF on every
retry. The returned document keeps the original `word` family and page
evidence. Its result carries the original and generated PDF hashes. Call
`Release` on every success or failure path.

The rendition adapter verifies source identity before submission. For PDFs it
compares the returned page count with that inspected count. For PPTX it counts
the listed PresentationML slides, rejects invalid slide references or
over-limit decks before upload, and compares the provider's processed count with
that local count. Configured DOCX uses the shared render route and keeps the
original `word` page evidence while the receipt records the generated PDF hash
and input bytes. Text formats use the response checks described above. See
[Mistral rendition processing](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/mistral/rendition.go)
for the exact source and result checks.

The PPTX count includes hidden slides. This assumes Mistral processes every
listed slide; the probe fixture contains one visible slide and does not verify
hidden-slide behavior. If Mistral skips hidden slides, the count comparison
fails after upload and may incur provider charges.

XLSX production uploads remain blocked because the provider's billable unit is
unverified. The generated probe has one worksheet with one cell. The recorded
worksheet-only control returned HTTP 200 with `pages_processed=1`; that result
does not distinguish worksheet counts from rendered-page counts. A paired
worksheet plus chartsheet request returned HTTP 500 with code `3700`.

Representative multi-sheet workbooks with long worksheets are needed to
establish how Mistral counts XLSX usage. A mismatch check after upload cannot
prevent charges. Even a successful XLSX extraction probe records no enforceable
unit bound and cannot authorize a production upload; manifests claiming a local
exact XLSX bound are rejected.

The importing application remains responsible for credentials, human consent,
spending and scheduling limits, durable manifests, job orchestration,
persistence, and search serving. Those application decisions are intentionally
outside the reusable packages and their policy identity.

## Prepare text for semantic retrieval

`document.BuildEmbeddingInputs` converts canonical normalized evidence into a
sealed generation of provider-ready document inputs. It never reads the
retained Markdown, so YAML frontmatter, checksums, build identifiers, and
navigation metadata cannot enter embedding text.

The processing profile's `EmbeddingChunkPolicyV1` declares how to build
chunks. It records the tokenizer name and revision, content token budget,
overlap, formatter, truncation policy, and attachment-context rules. A
tokenizer determines the token units that the model counts.

`document.NewInputPolicy` combines that declaration with:

- A `document.Tokenizer` implementation reporting the declared identity.
- The binding's fixed model-input contract.
- The lexical evidence fingerprint, which identifies the text evidence.
- The provider's hard token and byte limits for the complete rendered input.

The resulting policy belongs to one rendition-chunk binding.

```go
policy, err := document.NewInputPolicy(binding, tokenizer, lexicalFingerprint, nil)
if err != nil {
	return err
}

generation, err := document.BuildEmbeddingInputs(evidence, policy, document.GenerationLimits{
	MaxInputs:              10_000,
	MaxTotalContentTokens:  4_000_000,
	MaxTotalRenderedTokens: 5_000_000,
	MaxTotalContentBytes:   64 << 20,
	MaxTotalRenderedBytes:  80 << 20,
	MaxFittingWorkTokens:   50_000_000,
	MaxFittingWorkBytes:    1 << 30,
})
if err != nil {
	return err
}
```

Page, heading, region, and table boundaries are preferred before token
splitting. The configured token budget applies to content only; the document
role envelope and any declared attachment context are rendered on top of it,
and the complete rendered input is re-counted against the provider limits.
Overlap is measured in exact emitted tokens, and every input keeps its heading
path and the source span it was reconstructed from.

Generation limits can reject a build but cannot change its output. They do
not enter the fingerprints. All other policy values enter the generation's
policy fingerprint. If declared, `AttachmentContextSnapshot` also binds the
exact attachment titles and context to the generation's identity.

Use `MarshalEmbeddingInputGeneration` to produce the canonical byte form.
`DecodeEmbeddingInputGeneration` accepts only that form under explicit caller
limits. It rejects forged totals, policy fingerprints, and checksums.
`ToEmbeddingInputs` accepts only the exact model-input contract used to build
the generation.

`EgressIdentity` gives applications separate endpoint-sensitive fingerprints
for document embedding and query embedding. Credentials are not part of those
identities. `VectorSpaceIdentity` separately pins provider, model revision,
dimension, and normalization without an endpoint, allowing an application to
reuse compatible vectors while still requiring fresh consent when their
destination changes.

The shared retrieval helpers make omitted and `auto` search lexical, so a
query is not sent to an embedding provider without explicit `semantic` or
`hybrid` mode. Candidate limits default to 100 and are bounded at 1,000.
`CollectScopedCandidates` requires the backend to apply scope before its
vector cutoff and pages until authoritative exhaustion or a `limit+1`
overflow probe. Reciprocal-rank fusion preserves lexical and semantic signals
and reports overflow from either input lane or the fused union.

`document/embedding/eval` runs versioned public or synthetic corpora through
repeatable retrieval systems. Reports include Recall@5/10/20, nDCG@10, MRR,
critical misses, provider calls and input/output usage, estimated cost, and
latency. Repeated trials retain individual observations and report empirical
minimum, mean, and maximum values instead of hiding hosted-provider variance.
Applications should keep raw as the default unless measured results justify a
different recipe.

## Choose an embedding provider

The adapters below implement `document.EmbeddingProvider`. Their descriptors
pin the model-input contract, input kind, vector dimensions, and compatibility
identity. A provider package is not a daemon configuration option. Applications
must supply matching profiles, authorization, and named credential resolution.

| Provider package | Contract and scope |
|------------------|--------------------|
| [`document/openaicompat`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/openaicompat) | Explicit operator-hosted OpenAI-compatible text embeddings; deployment identity is required |
| [`document/openai`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/openai) | Fixed hosted `text-embedding-3-large` contract; separate from the operator-hosted adapter |
| [`document/mistral`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/mistral/embedding.go) | Hosted `mistral-embed` text embeddings |
| [`document/voyage`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/voyage/embedding.go) | Hosted `voyage-4`, `voyage-context-4`, and capability-authorized direct-file embeddings |
| [`document/cohere`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/cohere) | Hosted `embed-v4.0` text and inspected-image inputs; distinct document and query roles |
| [`document/gemini`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/gemini) | Hosted `gemini-embedding-2` text and authorized image, audio, video, and PDF files |
| [`document/zeroentropy`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/zeroentropy) | Hosted `zembed-1` text with explicit output encoding, latency policy, and dimensions |
| [`document/embeddingbridge`](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/tree/main/document/embeddingbridge) | Synchronous `docbank-embedding/v1` transport for text or authorized original files |

`openaicompat.BGEM3Profile` and `openaicompat.Qwen3Profile` build reviewed
self-hosted profiles. BGE-M3 uses one dense 1,024-dimensional vector. Qwen3
supports its 0.6B, 4B, and 8B models at their native dimensions and requires a
query instruction. Both pin weights and tokenizer revisions, pooling, and
sequence limits. These profiles exclude sparse and multi-vector outputs.
See the [deployment contracts](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/openaicompat/profiles.go).

Voyage contextual requests contain one document's ordered chunks. The shared
Voyage and Mistral adapters mark their mutable hosted aliases as export-only
and do not advertise a serving-time text query encoder. Do not infer query
compatibility from an equal vector dimension.

Gemini's profile selects inline bytes or the Files API. Direct-file requests
need matching inspected capability and disclosure fingerprints. The Files API
path includes bounded polling and cleanup; its policy identity records the
provider retention ceiling. The direct-file adapter accepts PNG/JPEG images,
WAV/MP3 audio up to three minutes, MP4/QuickTime video up to two minutes, and
PDFs up to six pages, subject to matching inspection bounds. The [Gemini contract](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/gemini/profile.go)
separates that provider retention from Docbank's local derivative retention.

The standard embedding bridge sends a canonical manifest before any file
parts and validates the synchronous response against exact input identities.
Its [OpenAPI contract](https://github.com/kenn-io/docbank/blob/main/document/embeddingbridge/openapi.yaml)
and JSON schemas own the wire limits.

## Detect and bound visual attachments

`media.Detect` identifies JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and MP4 from their bytes. It
does not trust the declared media type or decode pixels and samples. It reads
the metadata needed to enforce input limits:

- Dimensions, including every declared axis bound for MP4 and every GIF frame
  within the logical screen.
- Verified frame counts, including animated WebP and APNG.
- MP4 duration, using the longest movie, track, media, or sample-timing value.

MP4 video tracks must contain out-of-band H.264 (`avc1`/`avcC`) or H.265
(`hvc1`/`hvcC`) dimensions, plus `mdhd` and `stts` timing. The detector rejects
in-band or missing evidence as malformed. It does not substitute a smaller
container summary.

`media.Evaluate` checks byte, pixel, frame, and duration caps, plus the policy's
still-image, animation, and video settings. It returns stable reasons such as
`too_many_pixels` or `animated_not_allowed`. If the policy caps duration,
video with an unmeasurable duration is refused.

```go
metadata, reason, err := media.Inspect(reader, size, "image/png", media.DefaultPolicy())
if err != nil {
	return err
}
if reason != media.ReasonEligible {
	return recordIneligible(reason)
}
```

The package has no notion of attachment ownership, roles, or hashes; those are
application pre-filters.

## Embed images and video with Voyage

Voyage uploads fail closed until an operator has produced and supplied a
validated capability manifest for the pinned endpoint, model, and dimension.
Docbank ships no live manifest. Each capability is authorized separately:
JPEG, PNG, WebP, still GIF, animated GIF, and MP4 documents; text queries;
JPEG, PNG, WebP, and still GIF image queries; text-then-PNG queries;
text-then-media documents probed per format; and mixed-format batches at the
policy limit.
Whether animated GIF, video, or a given query shape may be sent is decided by
recorded probe evidence, not by assumption.

The operator prepares a manifest in this order:

1. Call `WriteProbeFixtures` to generate JPEG, PNG, and GIF fixtures and copy
   operator-supplied WebP and MP4 seeds.
2. Call `ValidateProbeFixtures` locally, without credentials or HTTP.
3. Create `NewClient(API key)` and call `RunCapabilityProbe`.
4. Review and retain the resulting `CapabilityManifest`.

WebP and MP4 cannot be encoded by the Go standard library, so the operator
supplies synthetic seeds named `image_webp.webp` and `video_mp4.mp4`, plus
contrasting `image_webp_alt.webp` and `video_mp4_alt.mp4` variants of the
same format whose content differs, so pixel contribution is demonstrated
within each format. The
seed directory, destination parent, and published fixture directory must be
owner-private, and fixture generation publishes a complete new directory
atomically rather than updating an existing directory. The
probe stores no media, vectors, or responses; the manifest records only
sanitized pass, reject, and fail observations.

For each production item:

1. Call `Policy.AuthorizeAll(validated manifest)`.
2. Check your application's consent record against `PolicyFingerprint`.
3. Call `media.Inspect` and require the item to be eligible under the policy.
4. Call `Client.EmbedDocuments(inputs, authorizations)`.

`EmbedDocuments` accepts only the probed input shapes `[media]` and
`[text, media]`. Before allocating a request, it enforces item and byte limits.
It also:

- Detects every media part again and serializes from the detected metadata.
- Requires authorization for each part's format and animation state.
- Requires that format's interleaved capability for `[text, media]`.
- Requires the batch capability for more than one input.

`EmbedQuery` accepts `[text]`, `[image]`, or `[text, image]`. Each shape needs
its own probed capability. Image authorization is per format; combined text and
image queries support PNG only.

Every response vector must have a unique index and the exact dimension.
The client does not follow redirects. Provider response bodies do not appear
in errors. Use `IsRetryable`, `RetryAfter`, and `MetricsFromError` when
scheduling retries.

The importing application remains responsible for credentials, human consent,
spending and scheduling limits, durable manifests, job orchestration, vector
storage, and search serving. Importing this library does not enable a vault
workflow. The daemon's separate retained-job requirements are documented in
[Configuration](configuration.md#embedding-workers-and-credentials).

## Convert CSV locally for PDF OCR

Use `document/csvpdf` to convert a declared `text/csv` source into a PDF for
the existing PDF OCR path. Conversion runs locally and never uploads content
or looks up credentials.

The converter verifies the source byte count and SHA-256, parses records,
labels each cell, and counts PDF pages before returning a result. It closes
`ocr.Source.Content` on every success and failure path.

```go
policy, err := csvpdf.NewPolicy(csvpdf.DefaultLimits())
if err != nil {
    return err
}
converted, err := csvpdf.Convert(ctx, originalCSV, policy)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
receipt := converted.Receipt()
pdfSource, err := converted.Source()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// Keep the receipt with pdfSource before a later caller authorizes upload.
```

The defaults are also hard ceilings. `NewPolicy` accepts positive, tighter
limits.

| Limit | Maximum |
|-------|---------|
| Source bytes | 1 MiB |
| PDF bytes | 10 MiB |
| Records | 10,000 |
| Cells | 50,000 |
| Bytes per cell | 64 KiB |
| Generated pages | 100 |

The embedded Go Mono font covers a subset of Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, and
common punctuation or symbols. Conversion rejects missing glyphs, characters
outside the Unicode basic multilingual plane, combining marks, shaping
scripts, formatting controls, and control characters other than cell newlines.
Use precomposed accented characters such as `é`.

CSV quoting, blank lines, and CRLF normalization follow Go's `encoding/csv`.
The output preserves empty cells, variable-width records, and quoted newlines.
Long cells continue onto later pages. Formulas remain literal text.

Keep the receipt with the source. It records original and generated hashes and
byte counts, the converter version, the policy fingerprint, and the mapping
from generated pages to original records and cells. Span identifiers start at
one. A record may span several pages. To cite a CSV cell from PDF OCR output,
use this mapping to translate the generated page reference.

The receipt does not authorize upload. Your application must:

1. Verify the PDF capability manifest and consent.
2. Choose PDF byte and page limits large enough for the conversion.
3. Retain the conversion policy with that consent.

This Go API does not add CSV OCR to the daemon or CLI.

## Convert DOCX locally to PDF

Use `document/renderpdf` when an application needs a local PDF derived from a
DOCX source. The converter uses an operator-pinned LibreOffice
executable. It first writes flat ODF inside the Linux sandbox, checks the
normalized XML for external or active content, and then renders only admitted
bytes to PDF.

### Set up the renderer

The built-in runner targets Linux on amd64 and arm64. It requires user, mount,
PID, network, and IPC namespaces, seccomp filters, and Landlock filesystem ABI 3
or newer. The application must be allowed to create those namespaces.
On Ubuntu, AppArmor may block unprivileged user namespaces; the operator's
AppArmor policy must allow the launcher to create them. Container policy must
also permit the required namespaces. Conversion fails if the required
isolation cannot be installed. macOS and Windows require an
application-supplied audited `renderpdf.Runner`.

On Debian or Ubuntu, install LibreOffice Writer and record the approved
executable's SHA-256 during operator setup:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y libreoffice-writer
sha256sum /usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin
```

`DefaultRuntimeRoots` selects Debian/Ubuntu paths for amd64 and arm64,
including LibreOffice, its libraries, and fonts. Other layouts need an
explicit list of runtime roots. Discover and retain the manifest during
operator setup, then build a policy from its files, symlinks, and identity.
Pass the approved executable digest as `executableSHA256`:

```go
package renderer

import "go.kenn.io/docbank/document/renderpdf"

func newDOCXPolicy(executableSHA256 string) (renderpdf.Policy, error) {
    manifest, err := renderpdf.DiscoverRuntime(renderpdf.DefaultRuntimeRoots())
    if err != nil {
        return renderpdf.Policy{}, err
    }
    return renderpdf.NewPolicy(renderpdf.Renderer{
        Executable:       "/usr/lib/libreoffice/program/soffice.bin",
        ExecutableSHA256: executableSHA256,
        Runtime:          manifest.Files,
        RuntimeSymlinks:  manifest.Symlinks,
        RuntimeIdentity:  manifest.Identity,
    }, renderpdf.DefaultLimits())
}
```

Keep the policy for subsequent conversions. Changed runtime bytes or a changed
executable fail verification; approve the updated installation and rebuild the
policy after a LibreOffice, library, or font update. Do not rediscover the
runtime or replace the approved digest for each input document.

### Convert a source

```go
converted, err := renderpdf.Convert(ctx, source, "docx", policy)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
receipt := converted.Receipt()
pdfSource, err := converted.Source()
if err != nil {
    return err
}
// Keep receipt with pdfSource before a later caller authorizes upload.
```

The DOCX profile emits FODT. Normalization strips unsafe external and active
constructs where LibreOffice can remove them; the normalized scan rejects any
such constructs that survive. It rejects every `xml:base` attribute, so local
fragment links cannot inherit an external base URI. Local formulas, internal
fragment links, and embedded raster images remain valid. Ordinary hyperlinks
to external sites or relative files are rejected if they survive normalization.
Embedded OLE objects, plugins, applets, and nested documents are also rejected;
this profile does not preserve every Word feature.

Each XML character-data token, including base64 image data, is limited to
1 MiB. A document within the overall byte limit can still exceed this limit
when it contains a large embedded image.

The receipt records both source and normalized identities, the exact PDF hash,
the page count, the policy, and the runtime identities. `Result.Source` is a
fresh `application/pdf` source. The receipt does not authorize upload. The
Mistral adapter reuses this receipt for its configured DOCX route; no daemon
option or CLI operation is added.

## Package boundary

The dependency direction is deliberate:

```text
application storage and workers
  -> document/mistral (optional provider transport)
  -> document (provider-neutral normalization)

application storage and workers
  -> document/voyage (optional provider transport)
  -> document/media (provider-neutral detection and eligibility)

application storage and workers
  -> document/embedding (provider-neutral text planning and retrieval contracts)
  -> document (provider-neutral normalization)
```

No public package imports Docbank's vault, database, daemon, or queue. Local
extractors can use `document` without depending on Mistral or any network
transport, applications can use `document/embedding` without a database or
provider client, and applications can use `document/media` alone to record
image dimensions at ingest without any provider.
