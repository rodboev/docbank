# docbank documentation

This directory holds the [zensical](https://zensical.org) documentation site
plus internal design material.

## Layout

- `*.md`, `usage/`, `architecture/` — published site content
- `stylesheets/` — published visual theme
- `scripts/` — source and built-site validation (never published)
- `internal/` — living agent/developer design documentation (never published)
- `zensical.toml` — site configuration
- `zensical-docs.sh` — build wrapper; validates sources, copies publishable
  content into a temporary tree, and checks the generated site's links,
  metadata, assets, and publishing boundary; all Python tools run through
  the locked `uv` environment

Every rendered directory route also publishes its exact Markdown source at the
sibling `.md` path. The operating page `/docs/setup/` has `/docs/setup.md`, and
`/docs/usage/importing/` has `/docs/usage/importing.md`. The product page and
authority guide follow the same rule at `/index.md` and `/guide.md`. Agents and
other text-first clients can use these stable representations without scraping
rendered HTML.

## Building

Run documentation commands from the repository root:

```bash
make docs-install  # one-time: install the locked Zensical environment
make docs-serve    # build and watch all three tiers on http://127.0.0.1:8000
make docs-build    # strict production build into site/
```

`make docs-serve` serves the product page, authority guide, and operating
documentation from one origin. It rebuilds after changes beneath `website/` or
`docs/`, or after the pinned screenshot commit or manifest changes. A failed
rebuild leaves the last successful `site/` available for inspection.

## Screenshots

Screenshot generation is a separate reviewed workflow. It never runs during a
documentation build or deployment.

1. Run `make docs-screenshots`. The harness starts a real daemon with a
   temporary synthetic vault and writes the complete capture set beneath
   `.superpowers/screenshots/`.
2. Inspect every generated image and its metadata.
3. Publish the complete reviewed set as one orphan `docs-assets` commit.
4. Put that exact commit in `scripts/docs-assets.ref` and run
   `make docs-assets-sync`.
5. Run `make docs-build` after the final source or asset-pin edit.

Never capture a developer vault, publish a partial set, or point the build at a
mutable branch head.

## Deployment

A software release makes a documentation source eligible; it does not publish
that source. The selected source is normally the documentation-only follow-up
after the tag and release notes exist. A maintainer must still authorize every
deployment.

Link the Vercel project once from the repository root with `make docs-link`.
Deploy an exact eligible source from a clean checkout with:

```bash
make docs-deploy DOCS_SOURCE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

The command checks that the source is on `origin/main`, descends from the latest
software release, and contains only approved documentation changes. It uploads
an unpromoted production build, waits for Vercel to verify it, repeats the
release check, and only then promotes the build. Deployment does not generate
screenshots, build the product, run Docker, or install frontend dependencies.

The protected `Deploy documentation` workflow provides the same path for an
explicitly supplied source SHA. It has no automatic push, pull-request, tag, or
release trigger.

## Documentation boundary

- User- and agent-facing pages explain shipped capabilities, exact contracts,
  and current limitations. They do not inventory future commands or endpoints.
- Public Architecture pages explain product behavior and durable boundaries.
  A future contract belongs there only when it materially explains design
  intent, and is always isolated under an explicit `!!! info "Planned"`
  admonition.
- `internal/` is the definitive developer description of how the system works
  and why. Update it in place with implementation changes; revise the matching
  public Architecture page when user-visible behavior or boundaries change.
- `roadmap.md` is the one high-level public view of product direction and
  status. It is not an execution ledger.
- Kata is the sole source of truth for actionable work, sequencing, ownership,
  blockers, and completion state. Do not copy that state into documentation.
